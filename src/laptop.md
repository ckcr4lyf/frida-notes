# Laptop

I am personally using Arch Linux. If you're on some kind of Linux distro, most of the stuff should be the same.

## Tools

Covers the tools needed on the laptop to help RE Android Apps

### Android Debug Bridge (adb)

We need to use [adb](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Android_Debug_Bridge) to interact with the phone from a CLI, including copying files to it, pulling files from it etc.

Install on arch: `pacman -S android-tools`

Some generic installation instructions are available on [XDA Developers](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/)
