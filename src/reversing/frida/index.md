# Frida

Frida is an incredible tool to inspect the state of a running app, extracting value from it, as well as hooking into functions to see what is being passed as an argument, what is being returned, and even the ability to modify these values.

We will start with some simple techniques, and then really dive into different obfuscation tactics and working around them.

I will try and have a small "Crack Me" `.apk` with each different kind of "technique".
