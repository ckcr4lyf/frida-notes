# Observing Network Traffic

In this section we will cover how to inspect the network traffic of the android phone to see what it is sending to remote servers, and what it is getting back.

This section is purely passive - we do not try and modify the request / responses.

Make sure you've installed the tools covered in the [laptop setup](/laptop.html#tools) and [android setup](/android.html) sections. Specifically, we need [mitmproxy](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy), [proxydroid](https://github.com/madeye/proxydroid) & [magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk). Other setup will be covered here.
